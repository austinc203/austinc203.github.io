                <p>Hello All! My name is Chris and this is my site dedicated to one of my favorite sports and hobbies, the great game of golf. I have experience both playing golf and working in the golf industry and have developed a deep love for this game, which is why I want to share it with you.</p>

                <h2>Equipment Reviews</h2>
                <p>This is where I am going to be talking about the various clubs I have been able to try out and what I thought of them. Personally, I am a Taylormade loyalist, but I am always willing to try out the latest and greatest.</p>

        <section class="gear-bg-image">
                <h2>Golf Gear</h2>
                <p>Much like my Equipment Reviews section, this is where I am also going to talk about the golf clothes, because I am a firm believer in the old saying, "Look Good, Play Good". Got to walk to the course feeling like you have already won and that starts with your clothes.</p>

                <h2>Favorite Players</h2>
                <p>As a PGA Tour fan, I have developed a great respect for the way that those players can hit the most amazing shots in the toughest conditions. Here are a few of the players that really seem to be able to do it all.</p>
