                <h2>Equipment Reviews</h2>
                <p>This is where I am going to be talking about the various clubs I have been able to try out and what I thought of them. Personally, I am a Taylormade loyalist, but I am always willing to try out the latest and greatest.</p>

        <section id="gear-reviews">
                <h2>Golf Gear</h2>
                <p>Much like my Equipment Reviews section, this is where I am also going to talk about the golf clothes, because I am a firm believer in the old saying, "Look Good, Play Good". Got to walk to the course feeling like you have already won and that starts with your clothes.</p>
