        <h2 id="abouth2">About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello All! My name is Chris and this is my site dedicated to one of my favorite sports and hobbies, the great game of golf. I have experience both playing golf and working in the golf industry and have developed a deep love for this game, which is why I want to share it with you.</p>

        <h2>Favorite Courses</h2>
        <p>I have been lucky enough in my time to be able to play some amazing courses, here are just a few that stick out in my head.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Patterson Club : Fairfield, CT</li>
          <li>Country Cub of Waterbury : Waterbury, CT</li>
          <li>Bay Creek Golf Club :  Virginia Beach, VA</li>
          <li>The King and Bear : St. Augustine, FL</li>
          <li>Farm Neck Golf Club : Edgartown, MA</li>
          <li>Bayonet and Black Horse : Seaside, CA</li>
          <li>Waterway Hills Golf Club : Myrtle Beach, SC</li>
          <li>Rolling Hills Country Club : Wilton, CT</li>
          <li>Torrington Country Club : Goshen, CT</li>
          <li>Edgartown Golf Club : Edgartown, MA</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>


        <h2>Equipment Reviews</h2>
        <p>This is where I am going to be talking about the various clubs I have been able to try out and what I thought of them. Personally, I am a Taylormade loyalist, but I am always willing to try out the latest and greatest.</p>

        <h2>Golf Gear</h2>
        <p>Much like my Equipment Reviews section, this is where I am also going to talk about the golf clothes, because I am a firm believer in the old saying, "Look Good, Play Good". Got to walk to the course feeling like you have already won and that starts with your clothes.</p>

        <h2>Favorite Players</h2>
        <p>As a PGA Tour fan, I have developed a great respect for the way that those players can hit the most amazing shots in the toughest conditions. Here are a few of the players that really seem to be able to do it all.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dustin Johnson</li>
          <li>Rickie Fowler</li>
          <li>Rory McIlroy</li>
          <li>Phil Mickelson</li>
          <li>Jason Dufner</li>
          <li>Keegan Bradley</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
